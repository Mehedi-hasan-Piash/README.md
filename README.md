### 👨‍🏫 &nbsp; About Me

<p align="justify">
 Hi, I’m Mehedi Hasan! I’m a web developer with in-depth experience in UI/UX design. In a nutshell, I create websites that help organizations address business challenges and meet their needs. I manage everything from website navigation and layout to a company’s web hosting and security architecture. My expertise lies within front-end web apps, and the main languages in my tech stack are JavaScript, React, and of course HTML/CSS. I’m a lifelong learner (currently taking a course on building AI chatbots with Python!) and love to read, run, and find new bubble tea shops in Bangladesh.
